The Research and Development (R&D) tax credit is one of the most valuable yet underutilized tax incentives available to tech companies. Many organizations miss out on significant savings simply because they don't realize their activities qualify.

## What Qualifies for R&D Credits?

The R&D tax credit applies to a broader range of activities than most companies realize:

### Software Development Activities
- Developing new software features or functionality
- Creating mobile applications or web platforms
- Building APIs and integration systems
- Database optimization and architecture improvements

### Technical Problem Solving
- Debugging complex technical issues
- Performance optimization efforts
- Security enhancement projects
- Creating new algorithms or processes

## Documentation Requirements

To claim R&D credits, you'll need to maintain detailed records:

1. **Project documentation** describing the technical challenges
2. **Time tracking** for qualifying personnel
3. **Expense records** for materials and supplies
4. **Technical specifications** and design documents

## Maximizing Your Credit Potential

### Identify All Qualifying Activities
Many companies only claim credits for formal R&D projects, missing day-to-day development work that qualifies.

### Include All Eligible Costs
- Direct labor costs for developers, engineers, and designers
- Contractor expenses for qualifying work
- Supplies and materials used in development
- Cloud computing costs for development environments

### Consider State Credits Too
Many states offer additional R&D credits that can be claimed alongside federal credits.

## Getting Started

If you haven't been claiming R&D credits, you can file amended returns for up to three years. This retroactive filing can result in substantial refunds.

Working with a qualified CPA experienced in R&D credits ensures you capture all eligible activities and maintain proper documentation for IRS compliance.
